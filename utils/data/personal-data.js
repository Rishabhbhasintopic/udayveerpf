  description: `I am Rishabh Bhasin — a thinker, builder, and explorer of technology.  
A student of computer applications and a creator at heart.  
From crafting Linux distributions like ELVORA to developing intelligent assistants,  
I channel my curiosity into solutions that empower digital freedom.  

Technology is more than a tool; it’s a language of possibilities.  
Whether coding smarter devices, designing interfaces,  
or leading projects at Rishabh’s LAB, I strive to blend logic with vision.  

I am not defined by a single title.  
I am a developer, designer, leader —  
and someone who asks "What more can be done?" and acts on it.`,
